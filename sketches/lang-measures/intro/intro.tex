\section{Introduction}

\subsection{Notation}

Let \(\Sigma\) denote a non-empty, countable alphabet.
Unless otherwise specified, assume \(\abs{\Sigma} < \infty\).
Write \(\varepsilon\) to mean the empty string.

Let \(\Sigma^\star\) be the set of all finite strings from \(\Sigma\).
Write strings as \(w\) or \(s\), whichever happens to be more convenient.

Let \(L\) denote a language, implicitly over \(\Sigma\).
In other words, \(L \subseteq \Sigma^\star\).

We treat the empty language \(\emptyset\) as distinct from
the language with a single empty string \(\braces{\varepsilon}\).

Let \(\mcal{L}\) be a family of languages.

Write deterministic finite automatons shorthand as DFA.

Write regular expressions shorthand as regex.
