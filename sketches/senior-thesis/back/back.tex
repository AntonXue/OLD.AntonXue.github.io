\subsection{Regular Languages and Finite Automata}



A regular language is a language that can be recongnized by a regular
expression.
Such languages play a central role in theoretical comptuer science
and formal language theory due to their ability to simply describe a
large class of strings.
We now formalize these terms.

Given a finite set of unique symbols \(\Sigma\) called the alphabet,
write the set of all finite strings constructed over this alphabet
as \(\Sigma^\star\).
A string is nothing more than a finite sequences of symbols from an alphabet.
Let \(\varepsilon\) denote the empty string which contains no symbols.

\begin{example}
  Consider an alphabet \(\Sigma = \braces{a, \alpha, b, \beta, \div}\),
  examples of strings (finite sequences) that can be constructed
  with this alphabet include
  \begin{align*}
    ab\beta\beta\alpha
      \qquad \qquad
    \div\div a \beta
      \qquad \qquad
    a a a a a a a
      \qquad \qquad
    \varepsilon
      \qquad \qquad
  \end{align*}
\end{example}

A language \(L\) is nothing more than a set of strings.
In other words, \(L \subseteq \Sigma^\star\).
We are now ready to introduce the concept of a regular language.
Formally, regular languages are a family of languages inductively
defined as follows:

\begin{enumerate}
  \item[(1)]
    The empty set \(\emptyset\) and the empty string language
    \(\braces{\varepsilon}\) are regular languages.

  \item[(2)]
    For each symbol \(a \in \Sigma\),
    the singleton language \(\braces{a}\) is a regular language.

  \item[(3)]
    If \(A\) and \(B\) are regular languages,
    then so is their union \(A \cup B\),
    their concatenation \(A \cdot B\), and their Kleene star \(A^\star\),
    defined as:
    \begin{align*}
      A \cup B
        &= \braces{w \st w \in A \cup B} \\
      A \cdot B
        &= \braces{w_a \cdot w_b \st w_a \in A, w_b \in B} \\
      A^\star
        &= \braces{w^k \st k \in \N, w \in A}
    \end{align*}
    Where \(w^k\) is the k-fold concatenation of a string to itself,
    and \(w_a \cdot w_b\) is the concatenaiton of strings
    \(w_a\) and \(w_b\).
    Sometimes we write \(w_a w_b\) for concatenation when context is clear.

  \item[(4)]
    No other languages are regular.
\end{enumerate}
