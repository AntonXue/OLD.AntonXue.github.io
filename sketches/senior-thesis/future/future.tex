\section{Conclusion and Future Work}

In this work we present our efforts towards embedding regular languages
into metric spaces.
Our goal here is to formally define and explore how different metrics
over regular languages work in both theory and practice.
To that end, we approach this question through the perpective of
measure theory, algebraic formulation, and boolean satisfiability.
Additionally, we present graph visual representations for sets of strings
that may be useful for future related endeavors.


\subsection{Graph Kernels}
We emphasize that there is still much to be done in the study of
regular languages and metric spaces.
One particular approach that we aim to tackle in the near future
is through the view of graph kernels~\cite{vishwanathan2010graph}.
Roughly speaking, graph kernels provide a way to embed graphs
into Hilbert spaces, on which inner products may be done.
We believe that this is an exciting direction with a lot of potential.
