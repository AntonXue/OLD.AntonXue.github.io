Language recognition is a fundamental problem in theoretical computer science.
Given an alphabet of unique symbols \(\Sigma\),
let \(\Sigma^\star\) denote the set of all possible finite strings over
the alphabet \(\Sigma\).
For some set of strings that we call a language \(L \subseteq \Sigma^\star\)
and string \(w \in \Sigma^\star\),
we then ask if \(w \in L\).
This is the language recognition problem.

A number of problems in theoretical computer science can be formulated
in terms of language recognition.
Does this string belong to the set (language) of valid email addresses?
Does this stirng belong to the set (language) of valid
computer programs written in my favorite programming language?
Does this string belong to the set (language) of solutions
to an instance of the boolean satisfiability problem?

Of the many questions that can be formulated in terms of language recognition,
one of central questions pertains to recognition of regular languages.
Regular languages are simple yet powerful:
they are indispensible in their ability to model
finite state machines,
describe structural patterns in strings,
and behave as a simple programming language model.
Abstractly, regular languages are precisely the set of languages that
can be described by the class of regular expressions.
Equivalently, they are the languages that are recognized by
(non)-deterministic finite automata.

However, because of the way they are defined, a ``flaw'' is that
two regular languages \(L_1\) and \(L_2\) may differ on a very small number
of strings, yet have very different representation sizes.
That is, \(L_1 \cap L_2\) may be very small,
but the (minimal) regular expression that can recognize \(L_1\) may be
very bit, while the regular expression used to recognize \(L_2\)
may be very small.
So how different is \(L_1\) from \(L_2\)?
In other words, how might we assign a metric between \(L_1\) and \(L_2\),
or more generally, over the space of regular languages?

One may attempt a classification with respect to their syntactic metric.
That is, a metric distance is defined with respect to a representation
without direct consideration for what strings the two sets may represent.
Alternatively, one may seek to determine a metric in terms of
the sets of strings in \(L_1\) and \(L_2\), which would be a semantic metric.
This metric would be independent of representation,
and would be defined over the space of regular sets.



Ideally, we would like a pair of metrics on the space of regular languages,
one syntactic and one semantic,
that are highly correlated.
That is, for
