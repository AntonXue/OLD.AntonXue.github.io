  In this work we study how regular languages can be embeded
  into metric spaces.
  This embedding allows us to rigorously discuss what it means for
  two regular languages to be similar:
  for them to share many strings and differ on few.
  Our work explores this question in the context of measure theory,
  algebraic formalization, and language separation.
  Additionally, we present graphical visualization techniques
  for sets of strings that will benefit future research endeavors.
