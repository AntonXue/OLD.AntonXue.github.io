===== Background

- Gradient descent and the PL inequality
  + GD is a simple first-order approach to optimization that iteratively
    searches for a local minimum.
    * For a differentiable real-valued function f.
  + A common condition provided that is sufficient for GD to converge
    at a linearly rate is convexity.
    * As a simple result (Lipschitz gradient condition yields ??? rate)
    * Alternatively if ??? is not assumed we can likewise derive that ...
  + However (strong) convexity isn't the weakest sufficient condition,
    and indeed weaker conditions have been studied in literature
  + As far back as the 1963's when Polyak and Lojasiewicz independently ...
  + The PL inequality states that ...
    * An equivalent to this is known as an "error bound" (cite)
    * Intuitively, the growth of the function is at least linear,
      which means that (1) it is lower bounded by a quadratic
      and that (2) it is invex, which means that all ....
  + As with proximal / projected methods for gradient descent,
    proximal methods can also be developed
    * Brief introduction: if you can decompose a function like ...
    * Relevant functions include ...
    * In the contxt of GD, proximal corresponds to
      - Interpretation when convex set
      - Moreau envelope smoothing

- Fazel et al's findings
  + Recent work by Fazel et al demonstrates that LQR satisfies the
    PL inequality and a condition dubbed "almost-smoothness".
    * Together, these are sufficient conditions to show that gradient
      descent over LQR converges to a global optimum.
    * Definition of gradient domination
    * Definition of almost smoothness
    * Convergence rate theorem presented in Fazel
    
  + 

  + Recently it has been shown that LQR satisfies the PL inequality
  + In the work of Fazel et al, the LQR's gradient and other things can be
    characterized as follows:
    * Introduce notation for \Sigma_K, E_K, and other things as necessary
    * remark about notation difference (use J instead of C)
  + Fazel et al's findings are interesting because ... historically these
    would have involved doing (XYZ expensive calculations / Ricatti equations)
    * Cite more things here


===== Approaches
- One challenge is to find what constraitns are a good idea to look at,
  begin by considering two primary variants: hard and soft constraints

- Infinite-horizon polytopic constraints on states
  + Not sure how to enforce this 

- Infinite-horizon hard quadratic penalty
  + Not sure how to do projected gradient on this

- Term-wise quadratic constraints
  + Interesting findings with the asymmetricness of eigenvalues
  + include proofs for what these would entail

- Infinite-horizon soft quadratic constraints
  + Makes the problem too easy almost immediately

- Proximal PL inequality
  + As a consequence of Karimi et al, functions of form F = f + g
    where f satisfies PL inequality and g allows for the PL inequality
    to go through would work as soft constraints that still makes Prox-PL work
    * For instances, these include things such as ...
  + Motivation is then to explore functions in this category
  + Mistaken attempt for restricted secant inequality
    * Algebraic mistake: thought that RSI + indicator of convex functions
      was sufficient for achieving the Prox-PL condition
    * However, still unknown if this is true.
    * The "most natural" route for f + indicator goes through a strong
      convexity argument, which takes form (sketch something)
  + LQR and RSI
    * Nevertheless interesting to see if LQR satisfies RSI condition
    * The proof goal
    * Approach 1:
      - Go into details + show where it gets stuck
    * Approach 2:
      - Go into details + show where it gets stuck
    * Draw back: insufficient mathematical tooling strength???

    
- Fundamental limits with NP-hardness
  + Result by Blondel et al states that ...
  + For LQR, the issue here is that
  



===== Discussion
- Inherent Challenges in First-Order Methods
  + NP-Hardness result

- Single controller for infinite trajectory time
  + Even if this is something that can be done
  + is it necessarily something that we want?
  + Not very adaptive to changes in environment
