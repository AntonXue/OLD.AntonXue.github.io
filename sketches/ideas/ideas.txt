Some ideas
----------

* Sturm-Liouville eigenvalue problems have discrete analogues in the form
  of difference equations; can they extend to automata theory somehow,
  such as via Brozowski derivatives?

* Topological properties such as connectedness for program analysis

* Abstract stone duality

* Random weights on NNs

* Random inputs to NNs

* Policy gradient does not affect correctness too much with online decisions
